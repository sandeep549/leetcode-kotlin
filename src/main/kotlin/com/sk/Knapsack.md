## 1. Problem Definition

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection such that:

- The total weight is less than or equal to a given limit (the "capacity" of the knapsack).
- The total value is as large as possible.

### Inputs:
- `values`: List of integers representing the value of each item.
- `weights`: List of integers representing the weight of each item.
- `capacity`: Maximum weight the knapsack can carry.

### Output:
- Maximum total value achievable without exceeding the weight limit.

## 2. Types of Knapsack Problems

- **0/1 Knapsack Problem**: Each item can be included or excluded. Cannot be broken into smaller parts.
- **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Items can be broken into smaller parts. Solvable using greedy approach.
- **Unbounded Knapsack**: Unlimited quantity of each item is available.

This document focuses on the **0/1 Knapsack Problem**.

## 3. Real-World Applications

- Resource allocation problems
- Budget management
- Cargo loading
- Portfolio selection

## 4. Solution Approaches

### 1. Recursive Approach (Naive)
This approach explores all combinations.

```kotlin
fun knapsackRecursive(weights: IntArray, values: IntArray, n: Int, capacity: Int): Int {
    if (n == 0 || capacity == 0) return 0

    return if (weights[n - 1] <= capacity) {
        maxOf(
            values[n - 1] + knapsackRecursive(weights, values, n - 1, capacity - weights[n - 1]),
            knapsackRecursive(weights, values, n - 1, capacity)
        )
    } else {
        knapsackRecursive(weights, values, n - 1, capacity)
    }
}
```

**Drawback**: Exponential time complexity \( O(2^n) \)

### 2. Memoization (Top-Down DP)
Optimized by storing intermediate results.

```kotlin
fun knapsackMemo(weights: IntArray, values: IntArray, n: Int, capacity: Int, memo: Array<IntArray>): Int {
    if (n == 0 || capacity == 0) return 0
    if (memo[n][capacity] != -1) return memo[n][capacity]

    memo[n][capacity] = if (weights[n - 1] <= capacity) {
        maxOf(
            values[n - 1] + knapsackMemo(weights, values, n - 1, capacity - weights[n - 1], memo),
            knapsackMemo(weights, values, n - 1, capacity, memo)
        )
    } else {
        knapsackMemo(weights, values, n - 1, capacity, memo)
    }
    return memo[n][capacity]
}
```

---

### 3. Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP)
Iterative and most optimized version.

```kotlin
fun knapsackTabulation(weights: IntArray, values: IntArray, capacity: Int): Int {
    val n = weights.size
    val dp = Array(n + 1) { IntArray(capacity + 1) }

    for (i in 1..n) {
        for (w in 0..capacity) {
            dp[i][w] = if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                maxOf(values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]], dp[i - 1][w])
            } else {
                dp[i - 1][w]
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n][capacity]
}
```

## 5. Kotlin Implementation Example

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val weights = intArrayOf(1, 3, 4, 5)
    val values = intArrayOf(1, 4, 5, 7)
    val capacity = 7
    val n = weights.size

    // Memoization
    val memo = Array(n + 1) { IntArray(capacity + 1) { -1 } }
    println("Maximum value (Memoization): ${knapsackMemo(weights, values, n, capacity, memo)}")

    // Tabulation
    println("Maximum value (Tabulation): ${knapsackTabulation(weights, values, capacity)}")
}
```

## 6. Time and Space Complexity

| Approach       | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Recursive      | O(2^n)           | O(1)             |
| Memoization    | O(n * W)         | O(n * W)         |
| Tabulation     | O(n * W)         | O(n * W)         |

Where `n` is the number of items and `W` is the capacity of the knapsack.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The Knapsack Problem is a classic example of how brute-force methods can be improved using Dynamic Programming. The Tabulation method is preferred in most cases due to its clarity and iterative nature. Kotlinâ€™s expressive syntax makes implementing these algorithms straightforward.

This problem not only helps in learning dynamic programming but also has direct applications in many optimization problems in real-world software systems.
